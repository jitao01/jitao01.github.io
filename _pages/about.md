I'm Tao JI, currently a PhD student in UCL's [Centre for Data Intensive Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry/) and [Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/mssl).

I’m from Mainland China and grew up in a small province in the central part of the country. In 2023, I earned a B.S. in Astronomy from Peking University, followed by an M.Phil. in Physics from The University of Hong Kong in 2025.  

Currently my research focuses on star and planet formation. I am hornored to join the [ALMA DMOST](https://alma-dmost.github.io/index.html) Large Program, which studies the structure of the dust and gas in disks around young Very Low Mass Stars, the most common type of star in our galaxy. 

Astronomy and Astrophysics
======
I’m broadly interested in astronomy and astrophysics, especially accretion. I studied accretion disks across scales using both observations and simulations. I enjoy playing with data and have experience analyzing photometric and spectroscopic observations of protoplanetary disks. I’ve also performed GRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto black holes. In my PhD, I plan to expand the use of AI and ML in astrophysics since now we are in a universe of data.

I’ve worked across several topics, but my goal has always been to deepen our understanding of the underlying physics. I believe early-career researchers should explore widely to find what excites them and aligns with their strengths, and I’m grateful to my supervisors for encouraging that exploration.  



**Markdown generator**

**The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
