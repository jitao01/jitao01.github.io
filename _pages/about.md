I'm Tao JI, currently a PhD student in UCL's [Centre for Data Intensive Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-intensive-science-industry/) and [Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/mssl).

I’m from Mainland China and grew up in a small province in the central part of the country. In 2023, I earned a B.S. in Astronomy from Peking University, followed by an M.Phil. in Physics from The University of Hong Kong in 2025.  

Currently my research focuses on star and planet formation. I am hornored to join the [ALMA DMOST](https://alma-dmost.github.io/index.html) Large Program, which studies the structure of the dust and gas in disks around young Very Low Mass Stars, the most common type of star in our galaxy. 

Astronomy and Astrophysics
======
I’m broadly interested in astronomy and astrophysics, especially accretion. I studied accretion disks across scales using both observations and simulations. I enjoy playing with data and have experience analyzing photometric and spectroscopic observations of protoplanetary disks. I’ve also performed GRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto black holes. In my PhD, I plan to expand the use of AI and ML in astrophysics since we now live in a universe of data.

I’ve worked on several very different topics, but my goal has always been to deepen our understanding of the underlying physics. I believe early-career researchers should explore widely to find what excites them most and aligns with their strengths, and I’m grateful to my supervisors for encouraging that exploration.  

This page is still under construction—more details coming soon. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or have suggestions. Thanks!
